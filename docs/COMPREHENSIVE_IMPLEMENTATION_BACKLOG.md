4. **Complex Task Decomposition**: AI breaks complex tasks into agent-specific steps

**Key Features to Implement**:

#### **2.2.1: Multi-Agent Coordination Engine (TDD - 3-4 hours)**
```go
// Target: AI coordinates multiple agents for complex tasks
User: "Analyze this document and then summarize the key points"

User: "Process this data file"
→ AI → file-processor: "What type of file is this?"
→ file-processor → AI: "It's a CSV with 10,000 rows"
→ AI adapts: "Large CSV detected, I'll use batch-processor instead"
```

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing tests for workflow adaptation
- [ ] **GREEN**: Implement adaptive workflow engine

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES DISCOVERED**

### **AI-Native Orchestration Enforcement (URGENT - P0)**
**Status**: ❌ **BROKEN IN PRODUCTION**  
**Priority**: **P0 - CRITICAL DESIGN VIOLATION**

**Problem Discovered**: 
- Orchestrator currently answers user requests directly without routing to agents
- AI does internal processing for tasks that should be delegated to specialized agents
- This violates the core AI-native orchestration principle

**Example Violation**:
```
User: "Count the words in hello world"
Current: AI answers directly → "The phrase 'hello world' contains 2 words"
Expected: AI routes to text-processor agent → Agent processes → Returns result
```

**Required Implementation**:
```go
// FORBIDDEN: Direct AI responses for non-orchestrator queries
if isUserTask(request) && !isOrchestratorMetaQuery(request) {
    return fmt.Errorf("DESIGN VIOLATION: All user tasks must route through agents")
}

// ALLOWED: Orchestrator meta-queries only
allowedDirectResponses := []string{
    "what agents do you have?",
    "what is the status?", 
    "show me agent capabilities",
    "list available agents",
    "orchestrator health check"
}
```

**Impact**: 
- ❌ Defeats the purpose of AI-native orchestration
- ❌ Agents become useless decorations
- ❌ No specialization benefits
- ❌ No capability-based routing
- ❌ No agent learning/optimization

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **T1**: Create failing test that enforces agent routing for all user tasks
- [ ] **T2**: Implement orchestrator meta-query detection
- [ ] **T3**: Force agent routing for all non-meta queries
- [ ] **T4**: Add agent capability requirements to system prompts
- [ ] **T5**: Comprehensive test coverage for routing enforcement
