üöÄ Development Backlog for Investor Demo
üéØ Goal of the Demo
Showcase your unique AI-native multi-agent orchestrator, focusing on runtime dynamic orchestration, graph-based capability management, and conflict resolution.

Duration: 15-minute investor demo.

‚úÖ Feature 1: Core AI Agent Registry
Description:

Agents can self-register by submitting their capabilities and associated metadata (description, inputs, outputs).

Data stored in a graph database.

Investor value:

Demonstrates automated, scalable onboarding of agents.

Shows infrastructure that can quickly scale to dozens or hundreds of agents.

Technical scope:

GraphDB schema (Nodes: Agents, Capabilities, Edges: Relationships).

API endpoints: POST /register, GET /agents, GET /capabilities.

Agent registration validation logic.

Demo requirements:

At least 3 different agent types auto-registering.

Clear visualization (simple web UI or CLI) showing the graph database update in real-time.

‚úÖ Feature 2: Dynamic Agent Selection & Runtime Orchestration
Description:

Real-time AI-driven matching of user requests to available agents.

The orchestrator analyzes user intent, traverses the graph database, and dynamically selects the best agent or combination of agents.

Investor value:

Highlights dynamic orchestration‚Äîunique vs. static workflow platforms.

Shows your platform's intelligence at runtime.

Technical scope:

AI-driven decision engine (GPT-based API calls for semantic matching).

Graph traversal algorithm for runtime agent selection.

gRPC/event-driven communication between orchestrator and agents.

Demo requirements:

Simple, compelling user query (e.g., "Analyze text sentiment and summarize").

Clearly demonstrate orchestrator decision-making in real-time via UI/logging.

‚úÖ Feature 3: Agent Capability Conflict Detection & Resolution
Description:

When new agents register, the orchestrator uses AI to detect conflicts in capabilities (overlap, duplication, quality differences).

The orchestrator places conflicting agents into a validation/suspended state based on AI-driven scoring.

Investor value:

Showcases your proactive, sophisticated conflict handling‚Äîunique differentiation.

Ensures capability quality, adding investor confidence in governance.

Technical scope:

Conflict scoring logic (LLM-driven semantic matching and confidence scoring).

Capability validation workflows ("active," "validation," "suspended" states in graphDB).

Historical capability performance data (graph-stored).

Demo requirements:

Two similar agents registering, triggering a conflict.

Clearly visualize AI-driven conflict detection and orchestrator decision/action.

‚úÖ Feature 4: Historical Confidence Scoring & Learning Loop
Description:

Store historical usage data for each capability execution (e.g., user satisfaction, success rate).

Historical data feeds into AI-driven scoring, influencing future agent selection.

Investor value:

Demonstrates system learning and continuous improvement over time.

Adds defensibility (moat) as your orchestrator‚Äôs decision quality improves over usage.

Technical scope:

Event store/database to track agent executions/results.

AI model/rules to update capability confidence scores dynamically.

Real-time usage of historical data during runtime orchestration.

Demo requirements:

At least 3 orchestrations showing increased capability confidence after successful execution.

Simple visualization showing confidence scores changing/improving after agent usage.

‚úÖ Feature 5: Tenant Isolation & Multi-Graph Support
Description:

Each customer/tenant has their own isolated capability graph.

Agents and orchestrations run in tenant-specific contexts.

Investor value:

Enterprise security and privacy clearly demonstrated.

Investor sees scalable SaaS/multi-tenant business model.

Technical scope:

Support multiple graphs (e.g., using namespace or tenant-id separation).

Secure isolation mechanisms in the graphDB/backend.

API layer enforcing strict tenant boundaries.

Demo requirements:

Show switching between two distinct tenants, each having unique registered agents/capabilities.

Prove graph isolation visually and programmatically.

‚úÖ Feature 6: Integration with Existing MCP Servers (GitHub, Slack)
Description:

Integration with GitHub MCP Server (e.g., create/update repo, pull requests).

Integration with Slack MCP Server (e.g., send orchestrator notifications).

Investor value:

Shows immediate practical enterprise value using existing ecosystem tools.

Validates MCP ecosystem interoperability.

Technical scope:

Simple MCP client for GitHub (using GitHub MCP server spec).

Simple MCP client for Slack (using Slack MCP API).

Basic orchestration workflows using GitHub/Slack MCP APIs.

Demo requirements:

A live demo showing a user request triggering GitHub/Slack operations.

Clear, real-time feedback in Slack or GitHub UI demonstrating orchestration.

‚úÖ Feature 7: Healthcare Vertical Demo (Optional but recommended)
Description:

Simple simulated healthcare agents (X-ray, ECG, Blood lab).

Demonstrate orchestrator ability to dynamically integrate multiple specialized agents into a single patient workflow.

Investor value:

Clearly proves platform universality across industry verticals.

Exciting visual/emotional narrative (patient care improvement).

Technical scope:

3 simple mock agents with basic input/output interfaces.

Orchestrator workflow logic demonstrating multi-agent integration.

Demo requirements:

Scenario-driven demo: "Patient with chest pain" triggering multi-agent analysis.

Show capability selection and confidence-based orchestration visually.

‚úÖ Feature 8: Basic Authentication Model (Hardcoded for Demo)
Description:

Simple hardcoded tokens for authenticating MCP integrations for demo purposes.

Investor value:

Sufficient to demonstrate integration without complexity.

Investors don‚Äôt care about detailed auth/security implementations at demo stage.

Technical scope:

Hardcoded OAuth tokens or PATs for MCP demo integrations.

Demo requirements:

Clearly mention "demo credentials" in the pitch‚Äîthis is an acceptable and standard practice at early stage.

üìå Key Messages for Your Copilot Developer AI

Emphasize simple, intuitive visualizations for each demo feature.

Ensure orchestrator decision-making logic (dynamic runtime decisions, conflict resolution, historical scoring) is clear and transparent.

Focus on ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù moments: runtime orchestration, real-time graph visualizations, dynamic conflict handling.
