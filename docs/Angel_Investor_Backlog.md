- Graph-native architecture and result synthesis
- AI decision-making and dynamic agent selection

**OPTION 2: Build Missing Features**
Implement 3-4 critical features from the list above to create a more complete demo.tor demo.

‚úÖ Feature 1: Core AI Agent Registry - **IMPLEMENTED**
Description:

Agent registration validation logic.

Demo requirements:

At least 3 different agent types auto-registering.

üîÑ Feature 2: Dynamic Agent Selection & Runtime Orchestration - **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**
Description:

Real-time AI-driven matching of user requests to available agents.

The orchestrator analyzes user intent, traverses the graph database, and dynamically selects the best agent or combination of agents.

**CURRENT STATUS:**
‚úÖ Basic AI-driven agent selection working
‚úÖ Graph traversal and agent matching implemented  
‚ùå Real-time visualization of orchestrator decision-making NOT implemented
‚ùå Advanced runtime orchestration UI missing

Investor value:

Highlights dynamic orchestration‚Äîunique vs. static workflow platforms.

Shows your platform's intelligence at runtime.

Technical scope:

AI-driven decision engine (GPT-based API calls for semantic matching).

Graph traversal algorithm for runtime agent selection.

gRPC/event-driven communication between orchestrator and agents.

Demo requirements:

Simple, compelling user query (e.g., "Analyze text sentiment and summarize").

Clearly demonstrate orchestrator decision-making in real-time via UI/logging.

‚ùå Feature 3: Agent Capability Conflict Detection & Resolution - **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
Description:

When new agents register, the orchestrator uses AI to detect conflicts in capabilities (overlap, duplication, quality differences).

The orchestrator places conflicting agents into a validation/suspended state based on AI-driven scoring.

**CURRENT STATUS:**
‚ùå No conflict detection logic implemented
‚ùå Agent status only supports: online, offline, busy, maintenance (no validation/suspended states)
‚ùå No AI-driven scoring for capabilities
‚ùå No capability validation workflows

Investor value:

Showcases your proactive, sophisticated conflict handling‚Äîunique differentiation.

Ensures capability quality, adding investor confidence in governance.

Technical scope:

Conflict scoring logic (LLM-driven semantic matching and confidence scoring).

Capability validation workflows ("active," "validation," "suspended" states in graphDB).

Historical capability performance data (graph-stored).

Demo requirements:

Two similar agents registering, triggering a conflict.

Clearly visualize AI-driven conflict detection and orchestrator decision/action.

‚ùå Feature 4: Historical Confidence Scoring & Learning Loop - **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
Description:

Store historical usage data for each capability execution (e.g., user satisfaction, success rate).

Historical data feeds into AI-driven scoring, influencing future agent selection.

**CURRENT STATUS:**
‚ùå No confidence scoring system implemented
‚ùå No historical usage tracking for capabilities
‚ùå No learning loops for agent performance improvement
‚ùå No capability performance metrics storage

Investor value:

Demonstrates system learning and continuous improvement over time.

Adds defensibility (moat) as your orchestrator's decision quality improves over usage.

Technical scope:

Event store/database to track agent executions/results.

AI model/rules to update capability confidence scores dynamically.

Real-time usage of historical data during runtime orchestration.

Demo requirements:

At least 3 orchestrations showing increased capability confidence after successful execution.

Simple visualization showing confidence scores changing/improving after agent usage.

‚ùå Feature 5: Tenant Isolation & Multi-Graph Support - **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
Description:

Secure isolation mechanisms in the graphDB/backend.

API layer enforcing strict tenant boundaries.

Demo requirements:

Show switching between two distinct tenants, each having unique registered agents/capabilities.
