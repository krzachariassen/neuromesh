# NeuroMesh AI-Native Orchestration Platform
## Current Status & Next Steps

**Document Updated**: June 30, 2025  
**Status**: Clean Architecture Migration Complete - Ready for AI-Native Enhancement

---

## 🎯 **CORE VISION: AI Controls Every Execution Step**

> **AI must be in the loop of EVERY execution step with bidirectional communication**

This is our north star: AI orchestrates every step dynamically, not rigid execution plans. The AI should decide, adapt, and coordinate all agent interactions conversationally.

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: AI-Native Execution Engine**

Based on `AI_NATIVE_EXECUTION_DESIGN.md`, we need to implement **AI controls every step**:

### **Target Flow (What We Want)**
```
User: "Count words: This is a tree"

AI Internal: "User wants word count. I have text-processor with word-count capability."

AI → text-processor: {
  "content": "Count words in the text: This is a tree",
  "type": "request",
  "parameters": {"text": "This is a tree", "action": "count-words"}
}

text-processor → AI: {
  "content": "Word count completed",
  "type": "response", 
  "parameters": {"word_count": 5, "text": "This is a tree"}
}

AI Internal: "Perfect! text-processor counted 5 words. I can respond to user."

AI → User: "I analyzed your text using the text-processor agent. The text 'This is a tree' contains 5 words."
```

### **Current Gap Analysis**
- ✅ We have all the infrastructure pieces
- ✅ **Agent Resilience**: Heartbeat system with unhealthy detection fully implemented
- ❌ **Missing**: AI-driven execution engine that processes agent responses
- ❌ **Missing**: Dynamic conversation flow where AI adapts based on agent responses

---

## 📋 **NEXT PHASE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: AI Conversation Engine (TDD - 2-3 hours)**

**RED**: Write failing tests for AI processing agent responses
```go
func TestAIConversationEngine_ProcessAgentResponse(t *testing.T) {
    // Test AI analyzing agent response and deciding next action
    // - Should AI respond to user?
    // - Should AI ask agent for clarification?
    // - Should AI coordinate with another agent?
}
```

**GREEN**: Implement AIConversationEngine
```go
type AIConversationEngine struct {
    aiProvider ai.Provider
    messageBus messaging.AIMessageBus
    graph      graph.GraphInterface
}

func (e *AIConversationEngine) ProcessAgentResponse(ctx context.Context, agentResponse *AgentMessage) (*NextAction, error) {
    // AI analyzes agent response and decides next step
}
```

**REFACTOR**: Clean up interfaces and optimize conversation flow

### **Phase 2: Agent Response Processing (TDD - 1-2 hours)**

**RED**: Test AI decision making on agent responses
```go
func TestAI_DecideNextAction(t *testing.T) {
    // Test various scenarios:
    // - Agent completes task successfully → Respond to user
    // - Agent needs clarification → Ask follow-up question
    // - Agent fails → Try different approach or explain limitation
}
```

**GREEN**: Implement AI response processing logic

**REFACTOR**: Optimize conversation patterns

### **Phase 3: Agent Resilience System (TDD - COMPLETED ✅)**

**✅ COMPLETED**: Agent resilience with heartbeat and unhealthy detection system is fully implemented and tested

**Achievements**:
- ✅ **Heartbeat gRPC Endpoint**: `OrchestrationServer.Heartbeat()` updates agent last seen timestamp
- ✅ **Agent Health Tracking**: Registry tracks agent health based on last heartbeat received
- ✅ **Unhealthy Agent Detection**: Agents become "unhealthy" if they miss heartbeats for 30+ seconds
- ✅ **Message Bus Cleanup**: RabbitMQ consumer tag management for proper cleanup
- ✅ **Stream Tracking**: Active gRPC streams tracked for cleanup on disconnect
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: All heartbeat and cleanup scenarios covered by tests

**Technical Implementation**:
```go
// Agent becomes unhealthy after 30 seconds without heartbeat
func (a *Agent) IsHealthy() bool {
    if a.Status != StatusOnline {
        return false
    }
    return time.Since(a.LastSeen) <= 30*time.Second
}

// Heartbeat endpoint updates last seen timestamp
func (s *OrchestrationServer) Heartbeat(ctx context.Context, req *pb.HeartbeatRequest) (*pb.HeartbeatResponse, error) {
    // Updates agent last seen time in registry
}
```

**Test Validation**:
- ✅ Agent registry tests: Health detection with 30+ second timeout
- ✅ gRPC server tests: Heartbeat endpoint functionality  
- ✅ Messaging tests: Consumer cleanup and connection resilience
- ✅ Domain tests: Agent health status logic

### **5. 🎯 CRITICAL PRIORITY: Agent Resilience & Heartbeat System (4-6 hours)**

**Goal**: Implement production-grade agent lifecycle management with automatic cleanup

**Core Design Principles**:
- 🔄 **Agents Can Reconnect**: Support offline agents coming back online
- ⚡ **Automatic Cleanup**: Remove dead subscribers without deleting agent registry
- 💓 **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Detect disconnected agents within 2 minutes
- 🏥 **Self-Healing**: Orchestrator automatically recovers from dead connections

**Implementation Requirements**:

**A. Heartbeat System (2 hours)**
```go
// Agent sends heartbeat every 30 seconds
type AgentHeartbeat struct {
    AgentID    string
    Status     AgentStatus  
    Timestamp  time.Time
    Health     HealthMetrics
}

// Orchestrator tracks last heartbeat
// If no heartbeat for 2 minutes -> mark agent as disconnected
// Clean up message bus subscriptions but keep agent registered
```

**B. Message Bus Resilience (2 hours)**
```go
// Add cleanup methods to MemoryMessageBus
func (mb *MemoryMessageBus) RemoveDeadSubscriber(participantID string)
func (mb *MemoryMessageBus) CleanupStaleConnections()

// Allow re-subscription of existing participants
func (mb *MemoryMessageBus) Subscribe(participantID string) {
    if exists, remove old subscription first
    then create new subscription
}
```

**C. Agent Status Tracking (1 hour)**
```go
// Registry service enhanced with status tracking
type AgentStatus string
const (
    AgentStatusOnline     = "online"     // Active and responding
    AgentStatusOffline    = "offline"    // Registered but disconnected  
    AgentStatusUnhealthy  = "unhealthy"  // Connected but failing
)

// Keep agent registration even when offline
// Only clean up message bus subscriptions
```

**D. Testing & Validation (1 hour)**
```go
// Test scenarios:
- Agent connects, disconnects, reconnects
- Agent crashes mid-conversation  
- Multiple agents with same ID
- Network partitions and recovery
- Orchestrator restart scenarios
```

**Expected Outcomes**:
- ✅ Agents can safely reconnect after crashes
- ✅ No more "already subscribed" errors
- ✅ Automatic detection of dead agents (2 min timeout)
- ✅ Message bus stays clean without manual intervention
- ✅ Agent registry persists across disconnections

**Tasks**:
- [ ] 🎯 Implement heartbeat mechanism in agent SDK
- [ ] 🎯 Add heartbeat processing to orchestrator
- [ ] 🎯 Enhance message bus with cleanup capabilities

**Simple but Powerful Demo Flow**:
```
User: "Count the words in this text: 'Hello world from AI orchestrator'"
AI:   "I'll use my text processing agent to analyze that for you!"
→ AI discovers text-processor agent capabilities
→ AI sends word-count task to agent  
→ Agent processes and returns: "5 words"
AI:   "The text contains 5 words: Hello, world, from, AI, orchestrator"
```

**What We Need to Complete**:
1. **Connect Agent SDK to Real gRPC**: Wire up the TODO placeholders
2. **Agent Registration**: Agent registers capabilities with orchestrator

- [ ] Add task assignment and result collection  
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow via chat UI

**Demo Capabilities**:
```
✅ "Count words in: 'Hello world'"          → "2 words"
✅ "Analyze this text: 'Hi! How are you?'"  → "4 words, 3 sentences, etc."
✅ "Format 'hello world' as uppercase"      → "HELLO WORLD"  
✅ "Clean up this messy text: '  hi   '"    → "hi"
```

### **7. 🚀 CRITICAL: Agent SDK (3 hours)**

**Goal**: Make it trivial for developers to create agents

**Features**:
