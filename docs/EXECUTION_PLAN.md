- [x] ✅ Add proper error logging and debugging

### **5. 🎯 CRITICAL PRIORITY: Agent Resilience & Heartbeat System (4-6 hours)**

**Goal**: Implement production-grade agent lifecycle management with automatic cleanup

**Core Design Principles**:
- 🔄 **Agents Can Reconnect**: Support offline agents coming back online
- ⚡ **Automatic Cleanup**: Remove dead subscribers without deleting agent registry
- 💓 **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Detect disconnected agents within 2 minutes
- 🏥 **Self-Healing**: Orchestrator automatically recovers from dead connections

**Implementation Requirements**:

**A. Heartbeat System (2 hours)**
```go
// Agent sends heartbeat every 30 seconds
type AgentHeartbeat struct {
    AgentID    string
    Status     AgentStatus  
    Timestamp  time.Time
    Health     HealthMetrics
}

// Orchestrator tracks last heartbeat
// If no heartbeat for 2 minutes -> mark agent as disconnected
// Clean up message bus subscriptions but keep agent registered
```

**B. Message Bus Resilience (2 hours)**
```go
// Add cleanup methods to MemoryMessageBus
func (mb *MemoryMessageBus) RemoveDeadSubscriber(participantID string)
func (mb *MemoryMessageBus) CleanupStaleConnections()

// Allow re-subscription of existing participants
func (mb *MemoryMessageBus) Subscribe(participantID string) {
    if exists, remove old subscription first
    then create new subscription
}
```

**C. Agent Status Tracking (1 hour)**
```go
// Registry service enhanced with status tracking
type AgentStatus string
const (
    AgentStatusOnline     = "online"     // Active and responding
    AgentStatusOffline    = "offline"    // Registered but disconnected  
    AgentStatusUnhealthy  = "unhealthy"  // Connected but failing
)

// Keep agent registration even when offline
// Only clean up message bus subscriptions
```

**D. Testing & Validation (1 hour)**
```go
// Test scenarios:
- Agent connects, disconnects, reconnects
- Agent crashes mid-conversation  
- Multiple agents with same ID
- Network partitions and recovery
- Orchestrator restart scenarios
```

**Expected Outcomes**:
- ✅ Agents can safely reconnect after crashes
- ✅ No more "already subscribed" errors
- ✅ Automatic detection of dead agents (2 min timeout)
- ✅ Message bus stays clean without manual intervention
- ✅ Agent registry persists across disconnections

**Tasks**:
- [ ] 🎯 Implement heartbeat mechanism in agent SDK
- [ ] 🎯 Add heartbeat processing to orchestrator
- [ ] 🎯 Enhance message bus with cleanup capabilities  
- [ ] 🎯 Add agent status tracking to registry
- [ ] 🎯 Create comprehensive resilience tests
- [ ] 🎯 Document agent reconnection procedures

### **6. 🚀 NEXT: End-to-End Integration & Demo (1-2 hours)**

**Goal**: Connect our Text Processing Agent to the AI Orchestrator for a working demo

**🌟 INTEGRATION TARGET: Text Processing Demo**

**Simple but Powerful Demo Flow**:
```
User: "Count the words in this text: 'Hello world from AI orchestrator'"
AI:   "I'll use my text processing agent to analyze that for you!"
→ AI discovers text-processor agent capabilities
→ AI sends word-count task to agent  
→ Agent processes and returns: "5 words"
AI:   "The text contains 5 words: Hello, world, from, AI, orchestrator"
```

**What We Need to Complete**:
1. **Connect Agent SDK to Real gRPC**: Wire up the TODO placeholders
2. **Agent Registration**: Agent registers capabilities with orchestrator
3. **Task Routing**: AI orchestrator sends tasks to appropriate agents
4. **Result Processing**: AI receives results and responds to user

**Implementation Tasks**:
- [ ] Wire agent SDK gRPC client to orchestrator protobuf
- [ ] Implement agent registration in orchestrator
- [ ] Add task assignment and result collection  
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow via chat UI

**Demo Capabilities**:
```
✅ "Count words in: 'Hello world'"          → "2 words"
✅ "Analyze this text: 'Hi! How are you?'"  → "4 words, 3 sentences, etc."
✅ "Format 'hello world' as uppercase"      → "HELLO WORLD"  
✅ "Clean up this messy text: '  hi   '"    → "hi"
```

### **7. 🚀 CRITICAL: Agent SDK (3 hours)**

**Goal**: Make it trivial for developers to create agents

**Features**:
```go
// Ultra-simple agent creation
agent := ztdp.NewAgent("data-processor").
    WithCapability("process-csv").

    OnMessage(func(msg ztdp.Message) {
        // Handle work
    }).
